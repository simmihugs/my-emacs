* Heatmaps 9/20 points
  Heatmaps are a frequently used visualization technique. In this
  exercise, we work out what heatmaps are and where they are used with
  help from public literature.
** Definition Heatmaps
   Give a definition (2-3 sentences) of heatmaps, then explain how to
   classify them.
** Examples of Heatmaps
   Find at least two different examples of heatmaps and discuss why a
   heatmap is (or is not) suitable for the data that are shown in the
   examples. Further, what advantages do heatmaps have compared to
   other types of charts? (max. 250 words)
** /Rainbow scale/
   A heatmap can be represented by different color scales. Why should
   we not use a rainbow scale?  Justify the answer. Which color scales
   are well-suited for heatmaps? Give an example and explain
   it. (max. 200 words)
* Color Scale 7/20 points
  Color scales aim to make data values and differences easily
  recognizable.
** /grayscale/
   Why is grayscale usually not considered a color scale? Name at
   least two advantages of using grayscale for data visualizations.
** Examples for single color scale
   Give three examples of the usage of single color scale and briefly
   evaluate them.
* Multiple Choice: Marks and Channels 4/20 points
  Mark the correct statements below.
  | $\square$        | The Expressiveness Principle says that the importance of an                                                             |
  |                  | attribute should match the salience of the visual channel.                                                              |
  | $\checkedsquare$ | The discriminability criterion takes into account i.e. how                                                              |
  |                  | many colors there are to tell apart in a visualization.                                                                 |
  |                  | What is the mark of a barplot? $\checkedsquare\quad$ Lines $\square\quad$ Point $\square\quad$ Size $\square\quad$ Axis |
  | $\square$        | For nominal data, length is an adequate channel to encode information.                                                  |
  
  *Reasoning:*

  1. Expressiveness Principle

     \noindent " _Effectiveness_ principle: importance of the attribute
     should match the salience of the visual channel" cite:InfoVis3.

  2. Discriminability

     \noindent "Discriminability: How many colors can I tell apart?"
     cite:InfoVis3.

  3. What is the mark of a barplot?

     \noindent "Bar charts encode two attributes using a line mark
     \dots" cite:munzner2015visualization.

  4. Adequate channel to encode nominal data

     \noindent Length, area, volume etc. is adequate for ordered
     (ordinal, quantitative) rather then nominal data cite:InfoVis3.
