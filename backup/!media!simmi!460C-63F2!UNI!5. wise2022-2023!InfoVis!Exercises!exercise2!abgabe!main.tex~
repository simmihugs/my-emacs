\section{Heatmaps 9/20 points}
\label{sec:org6f772d1}
Heatmaps are a frequently used visualization technique. In this
exercise, we work out what heatmaps are and where they are used with
help from public literature.
\subsection{Definition Heatmaps}
\label{sec:org71feba2}
Give a definition (2-3 sentences) of heatmaps, then explain how to
classify them.

\noindent \textbf{Answer:}

\noindent A heatmap is a visual representation, which depicts the
relationship of 2dimensional data. By using color, saturation and
brightness in order to intutively describe a large amount of data
to the observer, a heatmap points out the relevant key information,
in an easy and quick to understand way \cite{HeatMap}.

\noindent Heatmaps can be classified into grid heat maps, which are
2 or 3 dimensional grids (coordiante systems), where each axis
represents a trait. Or a spatial heat map, where a literal map is
used on which a color range from e.g. red to e.g. blue is
applied. The map functions as the first dimension of the data -
location. Whereas the color functions as the other dimension of the
data. 

\subsection{Examples of Heatmaps}
\label{sec:org02fb315}
Find at least two different examples of heatmaps and discuss why a
heatmap is (or is not) suitable for the data that are shown in the
examples. 

\noindent \textbf{Answer:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A heatmap in a heatmap camera

Firefighters and others using a thermographic camera to search a
missing persons. At night, the contrast of the body temperature
of the person, is very noticeable against the ground and the
woods in a forest.

A heatmap is suitable for this, because it highlights the
important information with a very usefull, high contrast.
The details are less important - you want to know where the
missing person is, not which color of hair this individual has.

\item FSME high-risk area

A map, where the areas are colored red, orange, yellow, light
green, dark green, based on the risk factor for a FSME infection
in these areas. (Important, I'm aware, that the maps one usually
finds in a doctors office on this topic are not heat maps but
choropleth maps where it is based on say Landkreis for instance,
where a real heat map is not concerned with average per
landkreis, but rather the actual data, wherever it appears on
the map.)

The heatmap is suitable, because it gives an observer a quick
and unmistakable feedback about the risk for an infection, given
the person knows enough geography to realize wether a risk area
is close. If the risk is high, better get vaccinated. Also the
color coding ist intutively understandable - red bad and green
good.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Advantages of Heatmaps}
\label{sec:orgf687e63}
Further, what advantages do heatmaps have compared to
other types of charts? (max. 250 words)

\noindent \textbf{Answer:}

\noindent Heatmaps can represent large amounts of data in a quick
and intutive form that is easy to unterstand. This is done by
using visual representations rather than numeric values, which
means, that a heatmap might be more approachable by a less
informed person. Heatmaps usually look amazing too, in contrast to
boring line and bar plots that is. This is infact important,
because people are lazy, boring things will be avoided, enticing
things will be studied. 

\subsection{\emph{Rainbow scale}}
\label{sec:org64127c4}
A heatmap can be represented by different color scales. Why should
we not use a rainbow scale?  Justify the answer. Which color scales
are well-suited for heatmaps? Give an example and explain
it. (max. 200 words)

\noindent \textbf{Answer:}

\noindent We should not use a rainbow scale, because the order of
the colors in the rainbow, is not immediately know. Most people
might have to thing about it. Even if you put a rainbow scale next
to the visualization, there is a lack in interpretation of the
heatmap. On top of that the color yellow "may draw too much
attention" \cite{infoVis2} which is somewhat problematic, as it is in
the middle of the scale, and the extreme values red and purple are
less prominent. More well suited for a heatmap are the color scales
red to green, yellow to blue or red to blue. An example would be a
neutral white color for 0degree, rising saturation color blue to
indicate cooling down and a rising saturation with color red to
indicate warming up.

\section{Color Scale 7/20 points}
\label{sec:org0238943}
Color scales aim to make data values and differences easily
recognizable.
\subsection{\emph{grayscale}}
\label{sec:org351216f}
\subsubsection{\emph{grayscale} not a color scale}
\label{sec:org15be119}
Why is grayscale usually not considered a color scale?

\noindent \textbf{Answer:}

\noindent Grayscale is usually not considered a color scale, as it
is merely a number of shades gray, which naturally provide a sense
of order \cite{infoVis2} (light to dark). Because of the advantages
the grayscale provide, it is still used instead of a real color
scale today. Grayscale, however comes with the disadvantage, that
the "number of just-noticeable-differences (JNDs) [ is ] about 60
to 90" \cite{infoVis2}, so you cannot use many differened shades of
gray and still distinguis them well. Therefore grayscale is
limited in comparision to other color scales.

\subsubsection{Advantages of using grayscale}
\label{sec:org4d026c5}
Name at least two advantages of using grayscale for data
visualizations.
\begin{itemize}
\item Grayscale visualizations can be used for being photocopying
processes, as the loss of color is not reducing the meaning of
the visualization as it might be the case for a colored
visualization.
\item Grayscale is in contrast to rainbow for instance naturally
ordered. Very bright is on on side, very light is on the other
side. So for visualizations where you need to express order, a
grayscale could potentially be used. E.g. a plot with lines
representing years where different shades of gray are used to
represend different years. The lighter years, might be the
recend ones, the dark ones are long ago.
\item In printing grayscale can be used, to reduce costs for
printing.
\item Only available option e.g. newspapers.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Examples for single color scale}
\label{sec:org37dd313}
Give three examples of the usage of single color scale and briefly
evaluate them.

\noindent \textbf{Answer}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ordered data - bad

Single color is used to represent the geographical height in a
map of an island. Very high, is represented by very bright, very
low by very dark. The lowest point is e.g. 300m below the sea
level, the highest is mountains peak at 1500m above sea
level.

There are multiple issues here. First because of the extreme
high mountain an the deep reafs there are either so many shades
of gray, that the coast line is barely noticeable - ships might
crash. Or very view shades of gray which results in a effect
where large chunks of ocean are represented as land mass and
vice versa. Without a secondary color, it is hard to point out
points and data of interest in the map.
\item Ordered data - good

In case of a zombie apocalypse, which hits the USA (where
else?), a map of the states is drawn, where with a single color
scale (probably in red) describes the zombie investation. Areas
are marked for how many zombies per square mile where very dark
red means a lot of zombies and light red stands for a manageable
amount of brain eaters.

The immediate usefulness is to know, where not to go and where
to fly because of the zombies. The problem with this is, that
eventhough dark red bad, light red less bad, what does it mean
in detail? Is the categorization linear or logarithmic?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{exercise2bii.png}
\end{center}
\item Categorical data
City map of munich. Every public restroom is marked with a
single color mark, a circle for instance. The map itself is in
the same color but as a clearly different brightness then the
marks and useful information like streets use a third,
clearly distinguisable shade of the color. If we use our own gps
location marked in a 4th. and final and still good to distinguis
mark we are set.

Given the small number of different points of interest, the
contrast is good enough and we can find a restroom in time. The
only major issue with this depiction is, that we almost reached
the max number of different shades of this color, that we can
use. One way to get away would be to draw borders around the
marks for the toilets, maybe use a circle for a toilet, a star
for our own location. Also, if we use the same shade for the
street as the shade for the border of the toilet cirlces, we
will still be able to distinguis because a street is a mostly
straight line - depending on the scale of our map.

\section{Multiple Choice: Marks and Channels 4/20 points}
\label{sec:orgc326718}
Mark the correct statements below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\(\square\) & The Expressiveness Principle says that the importance of an\\
 & attribute should match the salience of the visual channel.\\
\(\checkedsquare\) & The discriminability criterion takes into account i.e. how\\
 & many colors there are to tell apart in a visualization.\\
 & What is the mark of a barplot? \(\checkedsquare\quad\) Lines \(\square\quad\) Point \(\square\quad\) Size \(\square\quad\) Axis\\
\(\square\) & For nominal data, length is an adequate channel to encode information.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Reasoning:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Expressiveness Principle

\noindent " \uline{Effectiveness} principle: importance of the attribute
should match the salience of the visual channel" \cite{InfoVis3}.

\item Discriminability

\noindent "Discriminability: How many colors can I tell apart?"
\cite{InfoVis3}.

\item What is the mark of a barplot?

\noindent "Bar charts encode two attributes using a line mark
\dots{}" \cite{munzner2015visualization}.

\item Adequate channel to encode nominal data

\noindent Length, area, volume etc. is adequate for ordered
(ordinal, quantitative) rather then nominal data \cite{InfoVis3}.
