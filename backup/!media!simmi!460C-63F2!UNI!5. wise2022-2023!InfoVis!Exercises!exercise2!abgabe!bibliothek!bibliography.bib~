In this situation, the only possible test for an approximate theoretical solution is to compare with data generated from a computer simulation. In this paper, Monte Carlo tools are used to study and compare the elementary particles models. All the experiments are implemented using 10000 events, and the simulated energy is 13 TeV. The mean and the curves of several variables are calculated for each model using MadAnalysis 5. Anomalies in the results can be seen in the muons masses of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and the two Higgs doublet model.},

abstract = {Common variation in red-green color vision exists among both normal and color-deficient subjects. Differences at amino acids involved in tuning the spectra of the red and green cone pigments account for the majority of this variation. One source of variation is the very common Ser180Ala polymorphism that accounts for two spectrally different red pigments and that plays an important role in variation in normal color vision as well as in determining the severity of defective color vision. This polymorphism most likely resulted from gene conversion by the green-pigment gene. Another common source of variation is the existence of several types of red/green pigment chimeras with different spectral properties. The red and green-pigment genes are arranged in a head-to-tail tandem array on the X-chromosome with one red-pigment gene followed by one or more green-pigment genes. The high homology between these genes has predisposed the locus to relatively common unequal recombination events that give rise to red/green hybrid genes and to deletion of the green-pigment genes. Such events constitute the most common cause of red-green color vision defects. Only the first two pigment genes of the red/green array are expressed in the retina and therefore contribute to the color vision phenotype. The severity of red-green color vision defects is inversely proportional to the difference between the wavelengths of maximal absorption of the photopigments encoded by the first two genes of the array. Women who are heterozygous for red and green pigment genes that encode three spectrally distinct photopigments have the potential for enhanced color vision.},

  title    = "Systematic review of light exposure impact on human circadian
              rhythm",
  author   = "T{\"a}hk{\"a}m{\"o}, Leena and Partonen, Timo and Pesonen,
              Anu-Katriina",
  abstract = "Light is necessary for life, and artificial light improves visual
              performance and safety, but there is an increasing concern of the
              potential health and environmental impacts of light. Findings
              from a number of studies suggest that mistimed light exposure
              disrupts the circadian rhythm in humans, potentially causing
              further health impacts. However, a variety of methods has been
              applied in individual experimental studies of light-induced
              circadian impacts, including definition of light exposure and
              outcomes. Thus, a systematic review is needed to synthesize the
              results. In addition, a review of the scientific evidence on the
              impacts of light on circadian rhythm is needed for developing an
              evaluation method of light pollution, i.e., the negative impacts
              of artificial light, in life cycle assessment (LCA). The current
              LCA practice does not have a method to evaluate the light
              pollution, neither in terms of human health nor the ecological
              impacts. The systematic literature survey was conducted by
              searching for two concepts: light and circadian rhythm. The
              circadian rhythm was searched with additional terms of melatonin
              and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. The literature search
              resulted to 128 articles which were subjected to a data
              collection and analysis. Melatonin secretion was studied in 122
              articles and REM sleep in 13 articles. The reports on melatonin
              secretion were divided into studies with specific light exposure
              (101 reports), usually in a controlled laboratory environment,
              and studies of prevailing light conditions typical at home or
              work environments (21 studies). Studies were generally conducted
              on adults in their twenties or thirties, but only very few
              studies experimented on children and elderly adults. Surprisingly
              many studies were conducted with a small sample size: 39 out of
              128 studies were conducted with 10 or less subjects. The quality
              criteria of studies for more profound synthesis were a minimum
              sample size of 20 subjects and providing details of the light
              exposure (spectrum or wavelength; illuminance, irradiance or
              photon density). This resulted to 13 qualified studies on
              melatonin and 2 studies on REM sleep. Further analysis of these
              15 reports indicated that a two-hour exposure to blue light (460
              nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin, the maximum
              melatonin-suppressing effect being achieved at the shortest
              wavelengths (424 nm, violet). The melatonin concentration
              recovered rather rapidly, within 15 min from cessation of the
              exposure, suggesting a short-term or simultaneous impact of light
              exposure on the melatonin secretion. Melatonin secretion and
              suppression were reduced with age, but the light-induced
              circadian phase advance was not impaired with age. Light exposure
              in the evening, at night and in the morning affected the
              circadian phase of melatonin levels. In addition, even the
              longest wavelengths (631 nm, red) and intermittent light
              exposures induced circadian resetting responses, and exposure to
              low light levels (5-10 lux) at night when sleeping with eyes
              closed induced a circadian response. The review enables further
              development of an evaluation method of light pollution in LCA
              regarding the light-induced impacts on human circadian system.",
