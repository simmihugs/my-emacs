* Heatmaps 9/20 points
  Heatmaps are a frequently used visualization technique. In this
  exercise, we work out what heatmaps are and where they are used with
  help from public literature.
** Definition Heatmaps
   Give a definition (2-3 sentences) of heatmaps, then explain how to
   classify them.
** Examples of Heatmaps
   Find at least two different examples of heatmaps and discuss why a
   heatmap is (or is not) suitable for the data that are shown in the
   examples. Further, what advantages do heatmaps have compared to
   other types of charts? (max. 250 words)
** /Rainbow scale/
   A heatmap can be represented by different color scales. Why should
   we not use a rainbow scale?  Justify the answer. Which color scales
   are well-suited for heatmaps? Give an example and explain
   it. (max. 200 words)
* Color Scale 7/20 points
  Color scales aim to make data values and differences easily
  recognizable.
** /grayscale/
   Why is grayscale usually not considered a color scale? Name at
   least two advantages of using grayscale for data visualizations.
** Examples for single color scale
   Give three examples of the usage of single color scale and briefly
   evaluate them.
* Multiple Choice: Marks and Channels 4/20 points
  Mark the correct statements below.
  | \checkedsquare | The Expressiveness Principle says that the importance of an attribute should match the salience of the visual channel.               |
  | \checkedsquare | The discriminability criterion takes into account i.e. how many colors there are to tell apart in a visualization.                   |
  |                | What is the mark of a barplot? \checkedsquare\quad Lines \checkedsquare\quad Point \checkedsquare\quad Size \checkedsquare\quad Axis |
  | \checkedsquare | For nominal data, length is an adequate channel to encode information.                                                               |
